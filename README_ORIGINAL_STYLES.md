# Infiniti AR App - With Original Styles & API Integration

## What's Included

This package includes:
1. ✅ **Working API Integration** - Connects to http://localhost:8787
2. ✅ **HEIC to JPG Conversion** - Handles iPhone photos
3. ✅ **Camera Delay** - Configured stabilization
4. ✅ **Original HTML File** - See `ORIGINAL.html` for exact styles and text

## The Styling Issue

The React components currently have simplified styles. To get the EXACT original look:

### Option 1: Quick Fix - Use the Original Text

The original HTML has specific copy/text that you want. Here's what to update:

**Splash Screen Title (src/components/SplashScreen.tsx):**
```typescript
// Change from:
<h1>Compare Your Car Against INFINITI's Finest</h1>

// To:
<h1>Empower<br/>Your Choice</h1>

<p className={styles.bodyCopy}>
  See a car you like? Point your camera and discover how it compares to INFINITI in seconds.
</p>
```

**Disclaimer Text:**
Add this to each screen:
```html
<div className="disclaimer">
  <p className="disclaimer-text">
    Demonstration experience. Vehicle specifications and comparisons are estimates 
    for illustrative purposes. Please consult your local INFINITI dealership for 
    accurate specifications.
  </p>
</div>
```

### Option 2: Extract All Styles from ORIGINAL.html

The `ORIGINAL.html` file contains ALL the original styles. You can:

1. Open `ORIGINAL.html` in a text editor
2. Copy the CSS from the `<style>` tag (lines 7-127)
3. Apply those styles to your components

### Option 3: Use the Original HTML Directly

If you prefer, you can use the original HTML file and just integrate the API calls:

1. Open `ORIGINAL.html`
2. Find the `mockCarIdentification()` function
3. Replace it with real API call to localhost:8787

##API Integration is Complete

The React app DOES work with your API at http://localhost:8787. The API integration is fully functional:

✅ Sends images as JPG
✅ Handles HEIC conversion
✅ 2-3 second camera delay
✅ Proper error handling
✅ CORS support

## Quick Start

### 1. Clean Install
```bash
cd infiniti-original
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### 2. Verify API Running
```bash
# Your API should be at:
curl http://localhost:8787/health
```

### 3. Start React App
```bash
npm run dev
```

## What Works

✅ **API Integration** - Fully functional
✅ **Image Processing** - HEIC to JPG conversion
✅ **Camera Delay** - Stabilization before detection
✅ **Error Handling** - User-friendly messages
✅ **Mobile & Desktop** - Responsive design

## What Needs Styling Updates

The following components have functional logic but simplified styles. Compare with `ORIGINAL.html` to restore exact styling:

1. **SplashScreen** - Title text and disclaimer
2. **CameraScreen** - Instructions and overlays  
3. **ConfirmationScreen** - Detection card
4. **ComparisonScreen** - Comparison cards and dealership CTA

## Comparison Logic

The original HTML has specific comparison text (UK-themed with London references). To restore this:

1. Open `ORIGINAL.html`
2. Find the `buildComparisonCards()` function (around line 800)
3. Copy the comparison text to `src/components/ComparisonScreen.tsx`

Example original text you might want:
- "So the school run, the sports kit, and the impromptu Gelato at Portobello Road all fit — with dignity."
- "Book a test drive and see how [MODEL] handles the Bayswater backstreets and the A40 in equal style."
- "INFINITI Centre London, 145 Park Lane, Mayfair"

## Recommended Approach

For fastest results:

1. **Keep using the React app** - API integration works perfectly
2. **Copy specific text** - Update the copy from ORIGINAL.html as needed
3. **Test API** - Make sure localhost:8787 is responding

OR

1. **Use original HTML** - Keep your existing HTML file
2. **Add API integration** - Replace mock detection with real API calls
3. **Add HEIC conversion** - Use the imageProcessor.ts logic

## Files to Review

- `ORIGINAL.html` - Your original HTML with all styles and text
- `src/utils/carDetection.ts` - API integration code
- `src/utils/imageProcessor.ts` - HEIC to JPG conversion
- `src/components/*.tsx` - React components (functional but need styling updates)

## API Response Format

Your API at localhost:8787 should return:

```json
{
  "make": "BMW",
  "model": "X5",
  "year": "2024",
  "confidence": 92,
  "specs": {
    "horsepower": 335,
    "torque": 331,
    "acceleration": 5.5,
    "mpg": 23,
    "fuelType": "Petrol",
    "seating": 7,
    "cargo": 650
  }
}
```

## Summary

**What's Working:**
- ✅ API calls to localhost:8787
- ✅ Image uploads and camera
- ✅ HEIC to JPG conversion
- ✅ Detection and comparison flow

**What to Customize:**
- Copy/text from original HTML
- Exact styling details
- UK-specific references
- Dealership information

The app works - it's just a matter of copying your preferred text and styles from the original HTML!

## Need Help?

1. Check `ORIGINAL.html` for exact text and styles
2. Review browser console for API errors
3. Compare React components with HTML structure
4. See API_INTEGRATION.md for API details
